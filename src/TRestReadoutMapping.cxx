/// This class defines a uniform coordinate grid with XY-nodes. Each node
/// is associated to a channel and pixel from the readout module definition.
/// It is TRestReadoutModule::DoReadoutMapping the responsible to establish
/// the correspondence between nodes and the set (channel,pixel).
///
/// In complex readouts the pixel and channel can be hard to identify.
/// This class will be used by TRestReadoutModule::FindChannel in order to
/// try to guess the pixel and channel where a given coordinate is found.
